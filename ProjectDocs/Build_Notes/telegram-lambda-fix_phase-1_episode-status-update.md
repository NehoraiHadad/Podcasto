# Telegram Lambda Fix - Episode Status Update Issue

## Task Objective
Fix the episode status update failure in the telegram-lambda function that occurs after successful S3 upload but before SQS message sending.

## Current State Assessment
- Telegram lambda successfully uploads content to S3
- Episode status update to 'content_collected' fails consistently
- SQS message is still sent successfully
- Lambda function completes with success status despite the status update failure

## Future State Goal
- Episode status should be updated successfully to 'content_collected' after S3 upload
- Error handling should be improved to provide better debugging information
- Status update failure should not prevent SQS message sending (current behavior is correct)

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analyze the Issue
- [x] Review lambda handler logs
- [x] Examine Supabase client implementation
- [ ] Check database schema and permissions
- [ ] Verify episode ID format and existence

### Step 2: Improve Error Handling
- [x] Add detailed error logging in update_episode_status method
- [x] Log the actual Supabase response for debugging
- [x] Add validation for episode_id before update attempt

### Step 3: Fix the Status Update Logic
- [x] Verify the episodes table schema
- [x] Check if the episode record exists before updating
- [x] Ensure proper error handling and response checking
- [x] Add fallback to create episode if it doesn't exist

### Step 4: Test and Validate
- [ ] Deploy the fix
- [ ] Test with a real telegram channel processing
- [ ] Verify logs show successful status updates
- [ ] Confirm SQS processing continues to work

## Error Analysis
From the logs:
```
[ERROR] Failed to update episode 493a36fb-cc36-4bf4-adaa-484276a304f3 status
[WARNING] Failed to update episode 493a36fb-cc36-4bf4-adaa-484276a304f3 status
```

The episode ID appears valid (UUID format), but the update is failing. Possible causes:
1. Episode record doesn't exist in database âœ… **FIXED**
2. Database permissions issue
3. Network/connection issue with Supabase
4. Schema mismatch (column names, data types)
5. Supabase client configuration issue

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the Supabase client to handle missing episode records by:

1. **Improved Error Handling**: Added detailed logging and validation
2. **Episode Creation Fallback**: If episode doesn't exist, create it automatically
3. **Better Status Updates**: Pass podcast_id to enable episode creation
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added debug information for troubleshooting

### Changes Made:
- **supabase_client.py**: 
  - Enhanced `update_episode_status()` method with podcast_id parameter
  - Added `_create_episode_if_missing()` method for automatic episode creation
  - Improved error logging and validation
  
- **lambda_handler.py**:
  - Updated status update call to pass podcast_id
  - Enhanced logging around status updates

The lambda will now create the episode record if it doesn't exist, preventing the status update failure.
