# Authentication Security Improvement - Phase 1: Server-Side Authentication

## Task Objective
Improve the security of the authentication system by moving authentication logic from client-side to server-side where possible, reducing exposure of sensitive operations.

## Current State Assessment
The application currently uses the Supabase client-side library (`@/lib/supabase/client`) for authentication operations in the `use-auth.ts` hook. This exposes sensitive authentication operations directly in the client browser, which is less secure than handling these operations on the server.

## Future State Goal
Authentication operations should be handled by server-side actions where possible, with the client-side code only managing UI state and delegating actual authentication operations to the server. This will improve security by keeping sensitive operations on the server.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Current Authentication Implementation**
   - [x] Identify components using the Supabase client for authentication
   - [x] Understand the authentication flow and operations

2. **Create Server-Side Authentication Actions**
   - [x] Implement `signInWithPassword` server action
   - [x] Implement `signInWithGoogle` server action
   - [x] Implement `signUpWithPassword` server action
   - [x] Implement `signOut` server action
   - [x] Implement `resetPassword` server action
   - [x] Implement `getCurrentUser` server action

3. **Update Client-Side Authentication Hook**
   - [x] Modify `use-auth.ts` to use server actions instead of direct Supabase client calls
   - [x] Keep client-side state management and UI updates
   - [x] Update dependencies and imports

4. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] Test sign-in with email/password
   - [x] Test sign-in with Google
   - [ ] Test sign-up with email/password
   - [ ] Test sign-out
   - [ ] Test password reset

5. **Documentation and Code Cleanup**
   - [x] Document changes in build notes
   - [ ] Update any relevant documentation
   - [ ] Remove any unused code or imports

6. **Fixes and Adjustments**
   - [x] Fix Google OAuth sign-in by implementing proper PKCE flow with Server-Side Auth
   - [x] Update Google sign-in to request offline access for refresh tokens
   - [x] Ensure client properly redirects to the URL returned by the server action
   - [x] Fix URL redirection in development environment to use localhost instead of production URL

## Security Considerations
- Server-side authentication operations are more secure as they don't expose sensitive API keys or operations to the client
- ~~The Supabase client is still needed in the browser for real-time subscriptions (auth state changes)~~ Replaced with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for auth state changes
- OAuth flows with Google now use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security
- Server actions provide an additional layer of security and can include additional validation or rate limiting
- Requesting offline access allows us to get refresh tokens for longer-term authentication
- Environment-specific URL handling ensures proper redirection in both development and production

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing additional security measures like rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Review and update other areas of the application that might be using the client-side Supabase client
- Consider implementing refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Add proper error handling and user feedback for authentication flows
- Implement proper environment detection and configuration for different deployment environments
- [x] Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for auth state changes to replace client-side subscriptions
