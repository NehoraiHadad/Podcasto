# Gemini API Rate Limit Handling

## Task Objective
Implement robust rate limit handling in the Gemini API provider to ensure reliable performance when making multiple requests in quick succession, preventing 429 (Resource Exhausted) errors.

## Current State Assessment
The current Gemini provider implementation sends requests to the API without any retry mechanism. When rate limits are hit (which happens at 2-50 requests per minute depending on the tier), the application receives a 429 error and fails to complete the requested operation, resulting in poor user experience.

## Future State Goal
A more resilient Gemini API implementation that gracefully handles rate limiting through exponential backoff and retry logic, ensuring that operations complete successfully despite temporary API limitations.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research and understand Gemini API rate limits**
   - [x] Identify rate limit thresholds for various models and tiers
   - [x] Research best practices for handling 429 errors from Gemini API

2. **Design retry mechanism**
   - [x] Create RetryConfig interface for configurable retry parameters
   - [x] Implement exponential backoff algorithm with jitter
   - [x] Add proper error detection for rate limit errors (429 status codes)

3. **Implement the solution**
   - [x] Create a generic withRetry utility method in the GeminiProvider class
   - [x] Wrap all API calls with the retry mechanism
   - [x] Add appropriate logging for retry attempts
   - [x] Ensure error handling preserves original errors when retry fails

4. **Refactor for code quality**
   - [x] Extract retry logic into a separate utility file for reusability
   - [x] Modify GeminiProvider to use the extracted utility
   - [x] Ensure file length stays under the 150-line guideline

5. **Test the implementation**
   - [ ] Test with rapid successive API calls to trigger rate limiting
   - [ ] Verify that requests eventually succeed after backing off
   - [ ] Monitor logs to confirm correct behavior

6. **Documentation**
   - [x] Document the retry mechanism and configuration options
   - [x] Create this build note explaining the implementation

## Implementation Notes

The implementation adds a reusable retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle rate limit errors from the Gemini API. Key features include:

1. **Configurable retry parameters**:
   - `maxRetries`: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 5)
   - `initialDelay`: Starting delay in milliseconds (default: 1000ms)
   - `maxDelay`: Maximum delay between retries (default: 30000ms)
   - `backoffFactor`: Multiplier for increasing delay (default: 2)

2. **Error detection**:
   - Detects 429 status codes
   - Identifies "resource exhausted" error messages
   - Properly handles different error formats from the API

3. **Exponential backoff with jitter**:
   - Uses exponential growth of delay times (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.)
   - Adds randomization (jitter) to prevent thundering herd problems
   - Caps maximum delay to prevent excessive waiting

4. **Transparent integration**:
   - Wraps existing API calls without changing their interface
   - Preserves error stack traces for non-retryable errors

5. **Modular code structure**:
   - Retry logic is now in a separate utility file (`/src/lib/ai/utils/retry.ts`)
   - Generic implementation that can be used by other API providers if needed
   - Reduced GeminiProvider file size to comply with 150-line guideline

This implementation follows Google's recommended best practices for handling rate limits, ensuring that the application can reliably use the Gemini API even when making many requests.
