# Supabase Integration Updates

## Task Objective
Improve and update the Supabase integration to follow the latest best practices for Next.js App Router.

## Current State Assessment
The current Supabase integration is functional but has some issues:
- The server-side client implementation has linter errors
- The client-side implementation doesn't fully utilize TypeScript types
- The middleware implementation could be improved
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the latest best practices

## Future State Goal
A robust, type-safe Supabase integration that follows the latest best practices for Next.js App Router, with clear documentation and consistent API usage across the application.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update Supabase Client Files**
   - [x] Update client.ts to use proper TypeScript types
   - [ ] Fix server.ts implementation to resolve linter errors (see notes below)
   - [x] Create/update types.ts with database schema types
   - [x] Update middleware.ts to use the latest Supabase client

2. **Update API Functions**
   - [x] Update podcasts.ts to use the new client implementation
   - [x] Update subscriptions.ts to use the new client implementation
   - [ ] Ensure consistent error handling across all API functions
   - [ ] Add additional type safety to API responses

3. **Improve Documentation**
   - [x] Update README.md with latest best practices
   - [ ] Add code comments for complex operations
   - [ ] Document authentication flow

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test client-side operations
   - [ ] Test server-side operations
   - [ ] Test middleware authentication
   - [ ] Verify type safety across the application

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement query caching where appropriate
   - [ ] Optimize database queries
   - [ ] Add proper error boundaries for Supabase operations

## Notes
- The Supabase SSR package (@supabase/ssr) is now the recommended approach for Next.js App Router
- Cookie-based authentication is required for Server Components
- TypeScript types should be generated directly from the Supabase project for accuracy
- **Issue with server.ts**: There are persistent TypeScript errors related to the cookies() function in Next.js. This appears to be related to how the cookies() function is typed in Next.js. We've tried several approaches but haven't resolved the issue yet. This will need further investigation.
