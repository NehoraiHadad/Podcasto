# Build Notes: Telegram Integration

## Task Objective
Integrate Telegram API to fetch daily news content from predefined channels and process it directly into podcast episodes.

## Current State Assessment
- No Telegram integration implemented.
- Need to extract text, images, and URLs from specified channels.
- No structured storage or processing pipeline in place.

## Future State Goal
- Automatically fetch content from selected Telegram channels daily.
- Process extracted content directly into podcast episodes.
- Ensure the pipeline runs reliably and scales efficiently.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Setup Telethon API**
   - Register a Telegram API key.
   - Configure API credentials securely.
   - Establish a connection to Telegram.

2. **Fetch Channel Content**
   - Identify relevant Telegram channels.
   - Implement a script to fetch messages, images, and links.
   - Process data directly without storing it in a database.

3. **Data Processing & Podcast Creation**
   - Clean and filter unnecessary messages and links.
   - Structure data into a suitable format for podcast processing.
   - Pass structured data to Podcastfy for audio generation.

4. **Automation & Scheduling**
   - Deploy the script to AWS Lambda.
   - Schedule daily execution via a cron job or AWS EventBridge.
   - Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.

5. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Validate correct data extraction.
   - Monitor API rate limits and optimize requests.
   - Ensure scalability for multiple Telegram sources.

## Completion Criteria
- Successfully fetching and processing Telegram content into podcast episodes.
- Automation runs daily without manual intervention.
- Generated podcasts are ready for distribution.
