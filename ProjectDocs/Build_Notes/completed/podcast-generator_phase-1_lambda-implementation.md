# Podcast Generator Lambda Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement a Lambda function for podcast generation using the podcastfy library, supporting both URL-based and text-based content sources.

## Current State Assessment
The project has a basic Lambda function for podcast generation that only supports URL-based content and lacks proper error handling, configuration options, and documentation.

## Future State Goal
A robust Lambda function that supports both URL-based and text-based podcast generation with comprehensive error handling, configuration options, and documentation.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze existing code and requirements**
   - [x] Review the existing Lambda function implementation
   - [x] Understand the podcastfy library capabilities
   - [x] Identify requirements for the enhanced Lambda function

2. **Implement PodcastCreator class**
   - [x] Create a class to encapsulate podcast generation functionality
   - [x] Implement URL-based podcast generation
   - [x] Implement text-based podcast generation
   - [x] Add support for conversation configuration
   - [x] Add timing statistics for performance monitoring

3. **Enhance Lambda handler**
   - [x] Update Lambda handler to support both URL and text-based requests
   - [x] Add proper error handling
   - [x] Implement request validation
   - [x] Return detailed response with timing statistics

4. **Update dependencies and configuration**
   - [x] Update requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
   - [x] Ensure Dockerfile has all required components
   - [x] Create test events for both URL and text-based requests

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] Update README.md with comprehensive documentation
   - [x] Document API request and response formats
   - [x] Document configuration options
   - [x] Add troubleshooting information

6. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test URL-based podcast generation
   - [ ] Test text-based podcast generation
   - [ ] Test error handling
   - [ ] Test with various configuration options

7. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy to AWS using SAM CLI
