# AI Integration Phase 2: Code Optimization

## Task Objective
Optimize and simplify the AI image generation implementation to make it more maintainable while preserving all current functionality.

## Current State Assessment
The current implementation uses two separate providers (GeminiProvider and ImagenProvider) for image generation, with significant code duplication between them. The AIService has complex fallback logic that tries multiple providers in sequence. The code is longer than necessary and has redundant functionality.

## Future State Goal
A simplified, consolidated image generation implementation that eliminates code duplication, improves maintainability, and preserves all current functionality.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Consolidate Image Generation Code**
   - [x] Create a unified `ImageGenerator` class that handles all image generation
   - [x] Remove redundant code from multiple providers
   - [x] Ensure consistent error handling and retry logic

2. **Update AIService Implementation**
   - [x] Simplify the fallback mechanism
   - [x] Update the provider initialization logic
   - [x] Remove the unused 'imagen' provider type

3. **Optimize Dependencies**
   - [x] Remove the `ImagenProvider` class
   - [x] Update the ModelSelector utility to be simpler
   - [x] Ensure PostProcessingService uses the new implementation correctly

4. **Testing**
   - [x] Test image generation with primary provider
   - [x] Test image generation with fallback provider
   - [x] Verify error handling in failure scenarios

## Summary of Changes
- Created a dedicated `ImageGenerator` class that consolidates the image generation functionality
- Simplified the AIService implementation to reduce code complexity
- Updated the fallback mechanism to be more straightforward
- Removed unused code and redundant provider implementations
- Ensured all existing functionality is preserved
- Fixed API request errors by:
  - Updating the model name to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (instead of `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation`)
  - Removing unsupported parameters from API requests
  - Improving error handling logic for extracting image data
