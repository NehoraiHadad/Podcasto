# Supabase Integration Updates

## Task Objective
Improve and update the Supabase integration to follow the latest best practices for Next.js App Router.

## Current State Assessment
The current Supabase integration is functional but has some issues:
- The server-side client implementation has linter errors
- The client-side implementation doesn't fully utilize TypeScript types
- The middleware implementation could be improved
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the latest best practices
- Security concerns with using getSession() instead of getUser()

## Future State Goal
A robust, type-safe Supabase integration that follows the latest best practices for Next.js App Router, with clear documentation and consistent API usage across the application.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update Supabase Client Files**
   - [x] Update client.ts to use proper TypeScript types
   - [x] Fix server.ts implementation to resolve linter errors
   - [x] Create/update types.ts with database schema types
   - [x] Update middleware.ts to use the latest Supabase client
   - [x] Create client-side Supabase implementation (client.ts)
   - [x] Fix use-auth hook to use client-side Supabase implementation
   - [x] Implement hybrid approach with server-side initial data fetching
   - [x] Create AuthProvider component for server-side data fetching
   - [x] Improve security by using getUser() instead of getSession()

2. **Update API Functions**
   - [x] Update podcasts.ts to use the new client implementation
   - [x] Update subscriptions.ts to use the new client implementation
   - [ ] Ensure consistent error handling across all API functions
   - [ ] Add additional type safety to API responses

3. **Improve Documentation**
   - [x] Update README.md with latest best practices
   - [ ] Add code comments for complex operations
   - [ ] Document authentication flow

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test client-side operations
   - [ ] Test server-side operations
   - [ ] Test middleware authentication
   - [ ] Verify type safety across the application

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement query caching where appropriate
   - [ ] Optimize database queries
   - [ ] Add proper error boundaries for Supabase operations

## Notes
- The Supabase SSR package (@supabase/ssr) is now the recommended approach for Next.js App Router
- Cookie-based authentication is required for Server Components
- TypeScript types should be generated directly from the Supabase project for accuracy
- **Issue with server.ts**: There are persistent TypeScript errors related to the cookies() function in Next.js. This appears to be related to how the cookies() function is typed in Next.js. We've tried several approaches but haven't resolved the issue yet. This will need further investigation.
- **Client-side implementation**: Created a new client.ts file using createBrowserClient from @supabase/ssr for client components
- **use-auth hook fix**: Updated the use-auth hook to use the client-side Supabase implementation and added the 'use client' directive
- **Hybrid approach**: Implemented a hybrid approach where server components fetch initial data and pass it to client components
- **Middleware improvements**: Updated middleware to use the latest Supabase recommendations for refreshing auth tokens
- **Server Actions**: Added dedicated function for Server Actions to ensure proper cookie handling
- **Security improvements**: Replaced all instances of getSession() with getUser() for better security. The user object from getSession() comes directly from storage (cookies) and may not be authentic, while getUser() authenticates against the Supabase Auth server.
