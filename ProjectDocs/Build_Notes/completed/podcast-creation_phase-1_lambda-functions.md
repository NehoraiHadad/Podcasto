# Podcast Creation Lambda Functions Implementation

## Task Objective
Create AWS Lambda functions that enable podcast creation for administrators, including fetching data from Telegram, organizing it, creating conversations, generating audio files, and transferring data between functions.

## Current State Assessment
The project currently has a form for podcast creation, but lacks the backend Lambda functions to process the data and generate podcasts. There are existing code samples in the `checkLambda` directory that provide a foundation for the implementation, but they need to be adapted and improved for the current requirements.

## Future State Goal
A complete set of AWS Lambda functions that can:
1. Fetch and organize data from Telegram channels
2. Create conversation content based on the fetched data
3. Generate audio files from the conversation content
4. Transfer data between the Lambda functions
5. Store the generated podcasts for access by the application

## Implementation Plan

1. **Set up AWS SAM project structure**
   - [x] Initialize a new SAM project using `sam init`
   - [x] Configure the project with Python runtime
   - [x] Set up the necessary IAM roles and permissions
   - [x] Configure S3 buckets for storing data and audio files

2. **Create Telegram Data Collection Lambda**
   - [x] Adapt the existing Telegram collector code from `checkLambda/telegram-lambda`
   - [x] Implement authentication with Telegram API
   - [x] Create functions to fetch messages from specified channels
   - [x] Filter and clean the collected data
   - [x] Store the processed data in S3
   - [x] Add proper error handling and logging

3. **Create Podcast Generation Lambda**
   - [x] Implement conversation creation from the collected data
   - [x] Generate a script for the podcast
   - [x] Convert the script to audio using text-to-speech services
   - [x] Store the generated audio files in S3
   - [x] Add metadata for the podcast

4. **Create Bridge Lambda for Data Transfer**
   - [x] Implement a function to transfer data between the collection and generation Lambdas
   - [x] Add data validation and transformation as needed
   - [x] Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

5. **Set up API Gateway Integration**
   - [x] Create API endpoints to trigger the Lambda functions
   - [x] Implement authentication and authorization
   - [x] Connect the API to the admin form in the application

6. **Testing and Deployment**
   - [ ] Create test events for local testing
   - [ ] Implement unit and integration tests
   - [ ] Deploy the Lambda functions to AWS
   - [ ] Test the end-to-end workflow

7. **Documentation and Monitoring**
   - [ ] Document the Lambda functions and their APIs
   - [ ] Set up CloudWatch alarms and logs
   - [ ] Create a monitoring dashboard
   - [ ] Document the deployment process
