# Telegram Lambda Fix - Phase 1: Database Schema Fix

## Task Objective
Fix the telegram lambda function error related to missing `updated_at` column in the `episodes` table in Supabase database.

## Current State Assessment
The telegram lambda function was executing successfully but failing to update episode status due to a missing `updated_at` column in the `episodes` table. The error message was:
```
Error updating episode 999593bf-f083-4f4e-9abb-a5e5e4e2c29a status: 
{'message': "Could not find the 'updated_at' column of 'episodes' in the schema cache", 'code': 'PGRST204', 'hint': None, 'details': None}
```

## Future State Goal
The telegram lambda should be able to successfully update episode status without database schema errors. The `episodes` table should have an `updated_at` column that automatically updates when records are modified.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Identify the Issue ✅
- [x] Analyzed AWS CloudWatch logs for telegram lambda
- [x] Found the specific error related to missing `updated_at` column
- [x] Confirmed the lambda was working correctly except for status updates

### Step 2: Database Schema Investigation ✅
- [x] Connected to Supabase project `jjubdsxhqyfyrpxsjfmc`
- [x] Listed all tables and columns in the database
- [x] Confirmed that `episodes` table was missing `updated_at` column
- [x] Verified other tables like `podcasts` and `podcast_configs` have `updated_at` columns

### Step 3: Database Schema Fix ✅
- [x] Added `updated_at` column to `episodes` table with default value `now()`
- [x] Created trigger function `update_updated_at_column()` for automatic updates
- [x] Created trigger `update_episodes_updated_at` on `episodes` table
- [x] Verified the column was added successfully

### Step 4: Verification ✅
- [x] Confirmed `updated_at` column exists in `episodes` table
- [x] Verified recent episodes have `updated_at` timestamps
- [x] Checked security advisors for any additional issues

## Summary
The issue has been successfully resolved. The telegram lambda was failing because the Supabase `episodes` table was missing the `updated_at` column that the lambda code was trying to update. Added the missing column with appropriate default value and automatic update trigger. The lambda should now work without errors.

## Files Modified
- Supabase database: `episodes` table
  - Added `updated_at` column
  - Added trigger for automatic updates

## Next Steps
The telegram lambda should now work correctly. Future invocations should not encounter the schema-related error.
