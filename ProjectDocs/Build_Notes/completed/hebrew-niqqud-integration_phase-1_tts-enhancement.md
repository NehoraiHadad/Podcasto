# Hebrew Niqqud Integration - Phase 1: TTS Enhancement

## Task Objective
Integrate Hebrew niqqud (diacritical marks) processing module into the audio generation Lambda to improve TTS accuracy for Hebrew podcasts by adding proper vocalization to Hebrew text before sending to Google Gemini TTS.

## Current State Assessment
- Audio generation Lambda uses Google Gemini 2.5 Pro TTS for audio generation
- Hebrew text is processed without niqqud, leading to potential mispronunciation
- TTS client processes text directly without Hebrew-specific enhancements
- System supports multiple languages but lacks Hebrew-specific text processing

## Future State Goal
- Hebrew text is automatically processed with niqqud before TTS generation
- Improved pronunciation accuracy for Hebrew podcasts
- Seamless integration with existing TTS workflow
- Fallback mechanism for API failures
- Language-specific processing that only affects Hebrew content

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Dependencies and Module Creation
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Add required dependencies to requirements.txt
  - Added `cachier>=2.2.0` for API response caching
  - Added `beautifulsoup4>=4.11.0` for HTML parsing support
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Create Hebrew niqqud processing module
  - Created `hebrew_niqqud.py` with `HebrewNiqqudProcessor` class
  - Implemented Dicta API integration for Hebrew vocalization
  - Added text chunking for large content processing
  - Implemented Hebrew text detection and validation

### Step 2: TTS Client Integration
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Import niqqud processor in TTS client
  - Added import for `HebrewNiqqudProcessor` in `tts_client.py`
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Initialize processor in TTS client constructor
  - Added `self.niqqud_processor = HebrewNiqqudProcessor()` initialization
- [x] **Task 2.3**: Integrate niqqud processing in audio generation flow
  - Modified `generate_single_audio` method to process Hebrew text
  - Added niqqud processing before prompt preparation
  - Enhanced Hebrew language guidance with pronunciation emphasis

### Step 3: Error Handling and Fallback
- [x] **Task 3.1**: Implement robust error handling
  - Added try-catch blocks in niqqud processing
  - Implemented fallback to original text on API failures
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### Step 4: Language-Specific Processing
- [x] **Task 4.1**: Implement language detection
  - Added language code checking (he/hebrew/heb)
  - Added Hebrew character detection using Unicode ranges
  - Skip processing for non-Hebrew languages

### Step 5: API Integration and Caching
- [x] **Task 5.1**: Implement Dicta API integration
  - Added proper API payload configuration
  - Implemented response parsing and word extraction
  - Added validation for successful niqqud addition
- [x] **Task 5.2**: Add caching mechanism
  - Implemented `@cachier()` decorator for API response caching
  - Added text chunking for large content processing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Components Added:
1. **HebrewNiqqudProcessor Class**:
   - Handles Hebrew text detection and processing
   - Integrates with Dicta API for vocalization
   - Provides text chunking and caching mechanisms

2. **TTS Client Enhancement**:
   - Seamless integration with existing audio generation flow
   - Language-specific processing with fallback
   - Enhanced Hebrew language instructions

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation on API failures
   - Comprehensive logging for monitoring
   - Validation of niqqud addition success

### API Configuration:
- **Dicta API Endpoint**: `https://nakdan-2-0.loadbalancer.dicta.org.il/api`
- **Processing Mode**: Modern Hebrew genre
- **Features**: Morphological analysis, keeping diacritical marks
- **Chunking**: 10,000 character limit per API call

## Completion Status
- ✅ All implementation tasks completed
- ✅ Module created and integrated
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Language-specific processing added
- ✅ Dependencies updated

## Next Steps
1. Test the integration with Hebrew podcast content
2. Monitor API performance and caching effectiveness
3. Consider adding configuration options for niqqud processing
4. Evaluate TTS quality improvements with vocalized text

## Notes
- The implementation only processes Hebrew text, other languages are unaffected
- Caching is implemented to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Fallback mechanism ensures system reliability even if Dicta API is unavailable
- Text chunking handles large podcast scripts efficiently
