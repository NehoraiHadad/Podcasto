# Admin Access Control Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement a robust admin access control system for the Podcasto application that allows only authorized users with admin role to access the admin interface and perform administrative actions.

## Current State Assessment
The admin interface has been created, but there is no proper access control system in place. Currently, any authenticated user can access the admin interface by navigating to the `/admin` route.

## Future State Goal
A secure admin access control system that:
1. Restricts access to admin routes to users with admin role only
2. Provides server-side and client-side components to check admin status
3. Redirects unauthorized users to an appropriate page
4. Conditionally renders UI elements based on admin status

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Setup
- [x] Create a `user_roles` table in Supabase to store user roles
- [x] Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the `user_roles` table
- [x] Create a trigger to automatically set the first registered user as admin

### 2. Server-Side Implementation
- [x] Create server actions for admin role checking:
  - [x] `requireAdmin` - Redirects if not admin
  - [x] `checkIsAdmin` - Returns boolean
  - [x] `getUserRole` - Returns role string
- [x] Update middleware to protect admin routes
- [x] Update admin layout to use the `requireAdmin` server action
- [x] Update admin pages to use the `requireAdmin` server action

### 3. Client-Side Implementation
- [x] Create a `useAdmin` hook for client components
- [x] Create an `AdminGuard` component for conditional rendering in client components
- [x] Create an `AdminNavLink` component for conditional navigation links
- [x] Create an `AdminOnly` server component for conditional rendering in server components

### 4. Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation for the admin access control system
- [x] Document the database schema and RLS policies
- [x] Document the server actions and their usage
- [x] Document the client components and their usage
- [x] Document the server components and their usage

### 5. Testing
- [x] Test the admin access control system with different user roles
- [x] Verify that non-admin users cannot access admin routes
- [x] Verify that admin UI elements are only visible to admin users
- [ ] Test edge cases like expired sessions and token refreshes

### 6. Deployment
- [x] Run the SQL script to create the `user_roles` table in production
- [x] Deploy the updated codebase to production
- [x] Verify that the admin access control system works in production
