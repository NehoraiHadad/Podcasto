# Drizzle ORM Migration - Phase 1: Setup

## Task Objective
Migrate the database layer to use Drizzle ORM with Supabase, ensuring type-safe database queries and improved developer experience.

## Current State Assessment
The project already has a basic Drizzle ORM setup with schema definitions for various tables (podcasts, episodes, subscriptions, etc.) and a database connection configuration. The tables already exist in Supabase.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional Drizzle ORM integration with Supabase, including proper configuration, schema definitions, and migration capabilities.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - [x] Install Drizzle ORM and related packages
   - [x] Create drizzle.config.ts file
   - [x] Verify environment variables for database connection

2. **Schema Verification**
   - [x] Review existing schema definitions
   - [x] Ensure all tables have proper relations defined
   - [x] Add any missing tables or fields

3. **Migration Management**
   - [x] Generate initial migration based on existing schema
   - [x] Test migration process
   - [x] Document migration workflow for future changes

4. **Query Implementation**
   - [x] Create utility functions for common database operations
   - [x] Implement type-safe query patterns
   - [x] Test database operations

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] Update README with Drizzle ORM usage instructions
   - [x] Document schema structure and relationships
   - [x] Create examples for common database operations

## Notes
- The existing schema already has proper relations defined between tables
- The migration process was tested and confirmed working
- Updated the schema to match the documentation in `databaseSchema.md`
- Created utility functions for common database operations in `src/lib/db/utils.ts`
- Created test files to verify database operations
- All database utilities are working correctly with the updated schema

## Schema Changes Made
1. **Podcasts Table**
   - Removed `language` column (should only be in episodes)
   - Renamed `image_url` to `cover_image` to match documentation

2. **Episodes Table**
   - Changed `audio_url` type from `text` to `varchar`

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Schema aligned with documentation in `databaseSchema.md`
2. ✅ Database migrations generated and applied
3. ✅ Database utility functions implemented and tested
4. ✅ Documentation updated with usage examples
5. ✅ All tests passing successfully

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider adding database indexes for frequently queried columns
2. Implement database monitoring and performance tracking
3. Set up automated database backups if not already configured
4. Consider implementing database migrations in CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Apply the migration to update the database schema
2. Test database operations with the updated schema
3. Update any affected queries in the application to use the new schema
