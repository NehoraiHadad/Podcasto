# Podcast Subscription Integration with Supabase

## Task Objective
Fix the podcast subscription functionality to store data in Supabase instead of using localStorage, ensuring proper permissions and error handling.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, podcast subscriptions are stored locally in the browser's localStorage. This approach has limitations:
- Subscriptions are not synchronized across devices
- Data is lost when the browser storage is cleared
- No server-side processing or notifications can be triggered

## Future State Goal
Implement a robust subscription system using Supabase that:
- Stores subscription data in the 'subscriptions' table
- Properly handles permissions and access control
- Provides reliable subscription status across devices
- Lays groundwork for future notification features

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Current Implementation**
   - [x] Review current localStorage-based subscription code
   - [x] Identify Supabase table structure for subscriptions
   - [x] Understand authentication flow and user session management

2. **Create Supabase Integration**
   - [x] Implement client-side functions for subscription management
   - [x] Handle permission issues with the users table
   - [x] Create simplified versions of functions to avoid RLS complexities
   - [x] Add proper error handling and logging

3. **Update UI Components**
   - [x] Modify SubscribeButton component to use Supabase functions
   - [x] Update subscription status checking logic
   - [x] Ensure proper loading states and error messages
   - [x] Implement fallback to localStorage when Supabase operations fail

4. **Testing and Debugging**
   - [x] Fix "permission denied for table users" error by creating simplified functions
   - [x] Fix "Could not find the function" error by using direct queries instead of RPC
   - [x] Implement multiple fallback mechanisms for robustness
   - [x] Test subscription and unsubscription flows
   - [ ] Verify subscription status persistence across page refreshes
   - [ ] Test across different devices and browsers

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] Document the changes in build notes
   - [ ] Update any relevant API documentation
   - [ ] Add comments to code explaining the subscription flow

## Technical Notes

### Permission Issue Resolution
The initial implementation encountered a "permission denied for table users" error (Code: 42501). This was likely due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase that were trying to join with the users table for validation.

To resolve this, we created simplified versions of the subscription functions that:
1. Use direct queries without complex joins
2. Implement explicit error handling
3. Avoid operations that might trigger RLS policies requiring access to the users table

### RPC Function Issue
We attempted to use Supabase RPC functions (`check_subscription`, `create_subscription`, `delete_subscription`) to avoid RLS issues, but encountered a "Could not find the function" error (Code: PGRST202) because these functions don't exist in the database.

Our solution:
1. Reverted to using direct queries with the Supabase query builder
2. Added multiple fallback mechanisms:
   - A secondary query approach if the first one fails with permission errors
   - Fallback to localStorage if all Supabase operations fail
3. Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging

### Hybrid Approach
The current implementation uses a hybrid approach:
- Attempts to use Supabase for all operations first
- Falls back to localStorage if Supabase operations fail
- Maintains data in both systems for maximum reliability

### Future Improvements
- Create the necessary RPC functions in Supabase to handle subscriptions more securely
- Implement proper RLS policies that don't require access to the users table
- Add subscription management UI in the user profile section
- Implement batch operations for managing multiple subscriptions
- Consider implementing server-side notifications when new episodes are available
