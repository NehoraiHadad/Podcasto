# Home Page and Login Implementation - Phase 1

## Task Objective
Implement the home page and authentication flow with Supabase integration for the Podcasto application.

## Current State Assessment
The project has a basic Next.js 15 structure with App Router set up. There is no authentication implementation yet, and the home page is using the default Next.js template. The project has Supabase as a dependency but no integration has been implemented.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional home page with a modern, responsive design that showcases the Podcasto application's purpose. A complete authentication flow using Supabase that allows users to sign up, log in with email/password or Google OAuth, and access protected routes. The implementation should follow the authentication flow described in the project documentation.
