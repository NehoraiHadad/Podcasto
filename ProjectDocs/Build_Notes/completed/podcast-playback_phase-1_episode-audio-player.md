# Episode Audio Playback Implementation

## Task Objective
Implement podcast episode playback functionality using audio URLs stored in Supabase, allowing users to listen to podcast episodes directly within the application.

## Current State Assessment
- The database schema includes an `audio_url` field in the episodes table, which stores URLs to S3 audio files.
- There are existing podcast and episode listing pages that link to episode detail pages.
- There is a "Listen" button that links to episode detail pages, but these pages don't exist yet.
- There is no audio player component or playback functionality implemented.
- S3 URLs are stored in the format `s3://bucket-name/path/to/file.mp3` which requires conversion for browser playback.

## Future State Goal
- Users can navigate to individual episode pages and play audio content directly.
- A fully functional audio player with play/pause, seek, volume controls, and playback speed options.
- Audio playback state persists across page navigation.
- Episode metadata (title, duration, publication date) are displayed alongside the player.
- S3 protocol URIs are converted to playable HTTPS URLs on the server side with proper security.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Episode Detail Page Structure**
   - [x] Create episode detail page at `app/podcasts/[id]/episodes/[episodeId]/page.tsx`
   - [x] Implement server component to fetch episode data
   - [x] Create loading and error states for the page

2. **Develop Audio Player Component**
   - [x] Build a client-side audio player component using React hooks
   - [x] Implement basic playback controls (play/pause, seek)
   - [x] Add advanced features: volume control, playback speed, time tracking

3. **Connect Player to Audio Data**
   - [x] Create server action to generate secure S3 presigned URLs
   - [x] Connect audio player to episode data
   - [x] Implement error handling for audio loading failures

4. **Enhance User Experience**
   - [x] Add episode metadata display (title, description, duration)
   - [x] Implement responsive design for different devices
   - [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for playback control

5. **State Management**
   - [x] Implement persistence across page navigation using localStorage
   - [x] Add progress saving functionality

6. **Testing and Optimization**
   - [ ] Test playback functionality across different browsers
   - [ ] Optimize audio loading and buffering
   - [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance

## Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented the podcast episode audio player functionality:

1. Created an episode detail page structure with proper server-side data fetching
2. Developed a responsive audio player component with robust controls:
   - Play/pause, seek functionality
   - Volume control with mute option
   - Playback speed adjustment (0.5x to 2x)
   - Skip forward/backward capabilities
3. Added state persistence using localStorage to remember playback position
4. Implemented proper loading and error states
5. Designed a clean user interface with responsive controls
6. Improved S3 URL handling:
   - Moved S3 URL processing to the server-side using a server action
   - Implemented proper S3 presigned URL generation for secure access
   - Added better error handling for audio playback failures

The implementation allows users to navigate to individual episode pages and play podcast episodes directly from S3 URLs stored in Supabase. The audio player includes all standard playback features and maintains playback position even if the user navigates away and returns later.
