# Podcast Generator Lambda - Telegram Integration

## Task Objective
Enhance the podcast generator Lambda function to process and generate podcasts from Telegram channel data, enabling users to create audio content from their Telegram conversations and channels.

## Current State Assessment
The Lambda function currently supports generating podcasts from direct text input and S3 bucket content. However, it lacks the ability to process structured data from Telegram channels, which is a valuable source of content for podcast creation.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional Lambda function that can accept Telegram channel data in JSON format, process the messages with appropriate formatting, and generate high-quality podcasts that preserve the chronology and context of the conversations.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analyze Telegram Data Structure**
   - [x] Review sample JSON data from Telegram channels
   - [x] Identify key fields needed for podcast generation (text, date, media info, URLs)
   - [x] Determine optimal format for processing Telegram data

2. **Implement Telegram Data Processing**
   - [x] Create a method to process Telegram data in `app.py`
   - [x] Implement chronological sorting of messages
   - [x] Handle formatting of dates, media attachments, and URLs
   - [x] Convert Telegram data to a structured format suitable for podcast generation
   - [x] Change hardcoded Hebrew text to English for better internationalization

3. **Update Lambda Event Handling**
   - [x] Add support for the `telegram_data` field in the Lambda event
   - [x] Implement conditional logic to detect and process Telegram data
   - [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - [x] Create a test event JSON file for Telegram data (`test-event-telegram.json`)
   - [x] Update test event to use English instead of Hebrew
   - [x] Test the Lambda function with Telegram data locally
   - [ ] Validate podcast output quality and accuracy

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] Update README with Telegram data input format and examples
   - [x] Document the data structure required for Telegram inputs
   - [x] Add usage examples for Telegram data in documentation

6. **Optimization and Refinement**
   - [x] Remove timing_stats to simplify code
   - [x] Clean up unnecessary directory creation code
   - [ ] Optimize processing of large Telegram datasets
   - [ ] Add error handling for malformed Telegram data

7. **Deployment and Monitoring**
   - [ ] Deploy updated Lambda function
   - [ ] Monitor initial usage with Telegram data
   - [ ] Gather feedback for potential improvements
