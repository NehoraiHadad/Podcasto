# Transcript Storage - S3 Integration

## Task Objective
Implement functionality to automatically upload transcript files generated during podcast creation to S3, ensuring that these valuable text assets are preserved for future use.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, during podcast generation, transcript files are created and stored in the `/tmp/podcastify-demo/transcripts` directory. However, these files are lost when the Lambda function completes execution, as the `/tmp` directory is ephemeral.

## Future State Goal
After implementation, all transcript files will be automatically uploaded to S3 alongside audio files, following the same podcast/episode organizational structure. This will allow the transcripts to be accessed later for search, analysis, or display purposes.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Understand the current implementation**
   - [x] Identify where transcript files are stored during podcast generation
   - [x] Examine the existing S3 upload functionality for audio files
   - [x] Determine the appropriate S3 path structure for transcript files

2. **Design the solution**
   - [x] Create a method to scan for transcript files in the transcript directory
   - [x] Define a consistent S3 path structure for transcripts (podcast/episode/transcripts/filename)
   - [x] Integrate with existing S3 upload functionality

3. **Implement the feature**
   - [x] Add `upload_transcripts` method to the `BaseGenerator` class
   - [x] Modify `generate_podcast` method to call `upload_transcripts` after audio upload
   - [x] Ensure proper error handling that won't affect audio uploads if transcript uploads fail

4. **Test the implementation**
   - [x] Create unit tests for the transcript upload functionality
   - [x] Verify that transcripts are properly uploaded to S3
   - [x] Ensure error handling works correctly

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] Update the README.md to include information about the transcript upload feature
   - [x] Create detailed documentation in docs/transcript_upload.md
   - [x] Add implementation details to the build notes

## Summary
The transcript upload functionality has been successfully implemented. The system now automatically uploads all transcript files to S3 alongside the audio files, following the same podcast/episode organizational structure. This ensures that these valuable text assets are preserved for future use and can be accessed later for search, analysis, or display purposes.

The implementation is robust, with proper error handling to ensure that if transcript uploads fail, it doesn't affect the audio uploads. The feature is well-documented in both the README.md and a dedicated documentation file.
