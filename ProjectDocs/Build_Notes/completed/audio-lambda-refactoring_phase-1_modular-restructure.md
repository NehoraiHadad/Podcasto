# Audio Lambda Refactoring - Phase 1: Modular Restructure

## Task Objective
Refactor the audio generation Lambda codebase to improve modularity and maintainability by breaking down large files into smaller, focused components that adhere to the 150-line limit and DRY principles.

## Current State Assessment
The current audio generation Lambda has several issues:
- Multiple files exceed the 150-line limit (voice_config.py: 513 lines, gemini_script_generator.py: 367 lines, etc.)
- Potential code duplication across services
- Large monolithic classes that handle multiple responsibilities
- Complex interconnected dependencies that make testing difficult

## Future State Goal
- All files under 150 lines following project conventions
- Clear separation of concerns between different functionalities  
- Modular, reusable components with single responsibilities
- Improved testability and maintainability
- Consistent naming conventions (lowercase-with-dashes)
- RORO pattern implementation where applicable
- Elimination of code duplication
