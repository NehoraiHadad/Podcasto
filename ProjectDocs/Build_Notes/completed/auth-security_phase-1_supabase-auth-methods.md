# Supabase Auth Security: getSession() vs getUser()

## Task Objective
Improve the security of our authentication system by correctly implementing Supabase Auth methods, specifically addressing the security implications of using `getSession()` vs `getUser()`.

## Current State Assessment
Our application is using a mix of `supabase.auth.getSession()` and `supabase.auth.getUser()` methods across different components. In some server-side contexts, we're using `getSession()` which could potentially be insecure as it loads data directly from the storage medium (typically cookies) which may not be authentic.

## Future State Goal
Implement a secure authentication system that uses `supabase.auth.getUser()` for server-side authentication verification, while still leveraging `getSession()` where appropriate for performance reasons on the client side.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Understand the security implications**
   - [x] Research the differences between `getSession()` and `getUser()`
   - [x] Identify security vulnerabilities in current implementation

2. **Update server-side authentication**
   - [x] Modify middleware.ts to use `getUser()` for authentication verification
   - [x] Update page.tsx to use `getUser()` for authentication verification
   - [x] Ensure profile/page.tsx is using `getUser()` correctly (already implemented)

3. **Update client-side authentication**
   - [x] Modify use-auth.ts to use `getUser()` first for authentication verification
   - [x] Keep using `getSession()` for session data after authentication

4. **Document security best practices**
   - [x] Create this build note explaining the security implications
   - [x] Document the correct usage pattern for future development

## Security Implications

### `getSession()`
- Retrieves session data directly from the storage medium (cookies on the server)
- Data could potentially be tampered with by the sender
- Faster but less secure, especially on the server side
- Appropriate for client-side use where the frontend is never secure from user tampering anyway

### `getUser()`
- Performs a network request to the Supabase Auth server to verify the user's access token
- Returns authentic user data that can be used for authorization rules
- More secure but requires an additional network request
- Should always be used when checking for user authorization on the server

## Recommended Pattern

1. **Server-side authentication:**
   ```typescript
   // First authenticate the user with getUser() for security
   const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   
   // Then get the session data if needed
   const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
   ```

2. **Client-side authentication:**
   ```typescript
   // For client components, getSession() is acceptable for performance
   const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
   const user = session?.user || null;
   ```
