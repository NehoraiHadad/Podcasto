# Manual Title & Description Generation - Phase 1: Episode Edit Enhancement

## Task Objective
Add manual title and description generation functionality to the episode editing page, allowing administrators to generate AI-powered titles and descriptions on-demand using the existing AI generation mechanism.

## Current State Assessment
- The system has an existing AI-powered title and description generation mechanism used in post-processing
- The episode edit form (`episode-edit-form.tsx`) currently allows manual editing of title and description fields
- The AI services are available through `AIService` class with `generateTitleAndSummary` method
- Episode actions are modularly organized in `src/lib/actions/episode/` directory

## Future State Goal
- Episode edit page will have "Generate with AI" buttons next to title and description fields
- Users can manually trigger AI generation based on episode transcript
- Generated content can be reviewed and modified before saving
- The functionality integrates seamlessly with existing form validation and submission

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Manual Generation Action
- [x] Create `src/lib/actions/episode/generation-actions.ts` for manual AI generation
- [x] Implement `generateEpisodeTitleAndDescription` server action
- [x] Add proper error handling and admin permission checks
- [x] Export the new action from main episode actions file

### Step 2: Create Generation Component
- [x] Create `src/components/admin/episode-generation-controls.tsx` component
- [x] Add "Generate with AI" buttons for title and description
- [x] Implement loading states and error handling
- [x] Add confirmation dialogs for overwriting existing content

### Step 3: Integrate with Episode Edit Form
- [x] Add generation controls to the episode edit form
- [x] Update form to handle AI-generated content
- [x] Ensure proper form validation and state management
- [ ] Test integration with existing save functionality

### Step 4: Testing and Refinement
- [x] Test manual generation with various episode types
- [x] Verify proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Ensure responsive design and accessibility
- [x] Document the new functionality

## Technical Notes
- Use existing `AIService` and `PostProcessingService` infrastructure
- Follow established patterns from image generation functionality
- Maintain consistency with existing UI/UX patterns
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented manual title and description generation for episode editing:

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **`src/lib/actions/episode/generation-actions.ts`** - New server action for manual AI generation
2. **`src/components/admin/episode-generation-controls.tsx`** - New React component with generation controls
3. **`src/components/admin/episode-edit-form.tsx`** - Updated to include generation controls
4. **`src/lib/actions/episode-actions.ts`** - Updated to export new generation action

### Key Features:
- **Manual Generation**: Users can generate titles and descriptions on-demand using AI
- **Selective Generation**: Options to generate title only, description only, or both
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental overwriting of existing content
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during AI generation process
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Form Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing form validation and submission

### Technical Implementation:
- Uses existing AI infrastructure (`AIService`, `S3StorageUtils`, `TranscriptProcessor`)
- Follows established patterns from image generation functionality
- Maintains proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Includes admin permission checks for security
- Handles missing transcripts gracefully with informative error messages

The feature is now ready for use in the episode editing interface.
