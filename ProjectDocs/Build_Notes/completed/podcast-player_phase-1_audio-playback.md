# Build Notes: Podcast Player

## Task Objective
Develop a web-based podcast player to allow users to stream and interact with generated podcast episodes.

## Current State Assessment
- No podcast player implemented.
- Episodes are stored in Podbean, but no frontend component exists for playback.
- No user interaction features (e.g., play, pause, speed control).

## Future State Goal
- Embed an audio player on the **Podcast Page**.
- Allow users to **play, pause, seek**, and control playback speed.
- Display episode metadata (title, duration, language, etc.).
- Implement a **subscription button** for notifications.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Set Up Audio Player**
   - Choose an audio player library (e.g., React Audio Player, Howler.js).
   - Integrate it within the **Podcast Page**.
   - Fetch and display episode details from Supabase.

2. **Playback Controls**
   - Implement **play, pause, seek, volume** controls.
   - Add speed adjustment (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x).
   - Ensure responsiveness on mobile and desktop.

3. **User Interaction Features**
   - Allow users to **subscribe** to a podcast.
   - Display subscription status and allow toggling.
   - Implement a feedback message after successful subscription.

4. **Data Fetching & State Management**
   - Fetch episode list dynamically from Supabase.
   - Use Zustand for client-side state management.
   - Implement caching strategies for performance.

5. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Ensure smooth playback on all modern browsers.
   - Optimize loading times and buffering.
   - Test on different devices and networks.

## Completion Criteria
- Functional podcast player embedded in the **Podcast Page**.
- Smooth playback experience with all essential controls.
- Users can subscribe and receive podcast updates.
- Optimized performance and minimal latency.
