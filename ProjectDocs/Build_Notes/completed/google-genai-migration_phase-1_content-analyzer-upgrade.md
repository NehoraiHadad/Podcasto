# Google GenAI Migration - Phase 1: Content Analyzer Upgrade

**Build Date:** January 14, 2025  
**Task Objective:** Migrate the `content_analyzer.py` service from the deprecated `google.generativeai` library to the new unified `google.genai` SDK for improved performance, structured output support, and future compatibility.

## Current State Assessment

The `content_analyzer.py` service was using the deprecated `google.generativeai` library for AI-powered content classification and speaker role generation. This library is deprecated with support ending August 31, 2025. Other services in the Lambda function (`gemini_script_generator.py` and `tts_client.py`) had already been migrated to the new library, creating inconsistency.

**Key Issues:**
- Using deprecated `google.generativeai` import and API patterns
- Inconsistency with other migrated services
- Old JSON schema format for structured output
- Missing access to new features and improvements

## Future State Goal

Migrate `content_analyzer.py` to use the new `google.genai` unified SDK with:
- Modern client-based API approach
- Updated structured output using `types.Schema`
- Consistent library usage across all Lambda services
- Access to latest features and performance improvements
- Future-proof implementation aligned with Google's recommendations

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Step 1: Analysis and Planning
- [x] **Task 1.1:** Analyze current `content_analyzer.py` implementation (292 lines)
- [x] **Task 1.2:** Identify migration requirements and patterns from other services
- [x] **Task 1.3:** Research new library API and structured output approach
- [x] **Task 1.4:** Verify `requirements.txt` already includes `google-genai==1.18.0`

### ✅ Step 2: Code Migration
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Update import statements from `import google.generativeai as genai` to `from google import genai`
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Add `from google.genai import types` import for type definitions
- [x] **Task 2.3:** Replace `genai.configure()` with client-based `genai.Client(api_key=api_key)` approach
- [x] **Task 2.4:** Update `__init__` method to use client pattern (remove model initialization)
- [x] **Task 2.5:** Migrate JSON schema to `types.Schema` format with proper type definitions
- [x] **Task 2.6:** Update API call from `self.model.generate_content()` to `self.client.models.generate_content()`
- [x] **Task 2.7:** Update configuration from `genai.types.GenerationConfig` to `types.GenerateContentConfig`

### ✅ Step 3: Testing and Validation
- [x] **Task 3.1:** Verify all import statements are correct
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Ensure no remaining usage of old library patterns
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Confirm consistency with other migrated services
- [x] **Task 3.4:** Validate structured output schema format

## Migration Details

### Key Changes Made

1. **Import Updates:**
   ```python
   # Old
   import google.generativeai as genai
   
   # New
   from google import genai
   from google.genai import types
   ```

2. **Client Initialization:**
   ```python
   # Old
   genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
   self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
   
   # New
   self.client = genai.Client(api_key=api_key)
   ```

3. **Schema Definition:**
   ```python
   # Old (JSON schema)
   response_schema = {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {...}
   }
   
   # New (types.Schema)
   response_schema = types.Schema(
       type=types.Type.OBJECT,
       properties={...}
   )
   ```

4. **API Call:**
   ```python
   # Old
   response = self.model.generate_content(
       prompt,
       generation_config=genai.types.GenerationConfig(...)
   )
   
   # New
   response = self.client.models.generate_content(
       model='gemini-1.5-flash',
       contents=prompt,
       config=types.GenerateContentConfig(...)
   )
   ```

### Benefits Achieved

- **Future Compatibility:** Using the recommended unified SDK
- **Consistency:** All Lambda services now use the same library version
- **Improved Performance:** Better structured output support and validation
- **Enhanced Features:** Access to latest Google AI capabilities
- **Maintainability:** Aligned with Google's long-term SDK strategy

## Technical Notes

- Requirements already included `google-genai==1.18.0` - no dependency updates needed
- Other services (`gemini_script_generator.py`, `tts_client.py`) were already migrated
- Migration maintains all existing functionality and API contracts
- Structured output patterns now consistent across all AI services
- No breaking changes to external interfaces or error handling

## Validation Results

✅ **Import Consistency:** All services now use `from google import genai`  
✅ **API Pattern Consistency:** All services use client-based approach  
✅ **Schema Format:** Proper `types.Schema` usage for structured output  
✅ **No Deprecated Code:** No remaining `google.generativeai` references  
✅ **Functionality Preserved:** All content analysis features maintained  

## Summary

Successfully migrated `content_analyzer.py` from the deprecated `google.generativeai` library to the new unified `google.genai` SDK. The migration ensures:

- Consistency across all Lambda AI services
- Future compatibility with Google's SDK roadmap
- Access to latest features and performance improvements
- Maintained functionality while improving code quality

The Lambda function now uses a unified, modern approach to Google AI services with better structured output support and enhanced reliability.
