# Gemini Model Update 2025 - Simplified

## Task Objective
Simplify the Gemini provider implementation to exclusively use the latest models (2.0 and 2.5 series) and eliminate legacy API version compatibility layers.

## Current State Assessment
The previous Gemini provider had a complex implementation with compatibility checks for different API versions and model families. This added unnecessary complexity and made the code harder to maintain. The image prompt generation feature was failing due to API compatibility issues.

## Future State Goal
A streamlined Gemini provider that:
1. Exclusively uses the latest models (Gemini 2.0 and 2.5)
2. Eliminates API version compatibility checks
3. Provides simple model selection for different tasks
4. Maintains high-quality output for all AI features

## Implementation Plan

1. **Simplify Gemini Provider Implementation**
   - [x] Remove API version compatibility checks
   - [x] Set defaults to latest models only
   - [x] Remove unnecessary logging and complexity
   - [x] Streamline error handling

2. **Simplify Model Selection Utility**
   - [x] Remove API version parameters
   - [x] Create task-specific model recommendations for latest models only
   - [x] Simplify the interface for easier developer use

3. **Update Post-Processing Service**
   - [x] Update image prompt generation to use latest models
   - [x] Remove API version references

4. **Documentation**
   - [x] Update documentation to reflect simplified approach
   - [x] Document recommended models by task
   - [x] Update build notes

5. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test image generation with updated models
   - [ ] Verify text generation works correctly
   - [ ] Ensure all AI features function properly with new implementation

## Additional Notes

- The library `@google/generative-ai` has been updated to the latest version (0.24.0).
- All features now use the most advanced models available, which should improve output quality.
- The simplified approach makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand.
- The primary text model is now `gemini-2.5-pro` and the image generation model remains `gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation`.
