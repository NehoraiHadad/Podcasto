# Admin Dashboard - Podcast Creation

## Task Objective
Create an admin dashboard page for podcast creation that allows administrators to configure and generate podcasts from various content sources.

## Current State Assessment
Currently, the application has a basic structure for an admin section, but no implementation for podcast creation functionality. The admin section needs a dedicated interface for configuring and generating podcasts from Telegram channels and other sources.

## Future State Goal
A fully functional admin dashboard with a podcast creation form that allows administrators to:
1. Select content sources (Telegram channels or URLs)
2. Configure podcast metadata (title, creator, description, cover image)
3. Set basic podcast settings (name, output language, creativity level)
4. Configure advanced settings (long podcast toggle, discussion rounds, minimum characters per round)
5. Set conversation style and speaker roles
6. Add mixing techniques and additional instructions
