# Podcast Processing Flow

## Overview
This document details the automated process of converting Telegram content into structured podcast episodes. The pipeline ensures efficient content extraction, transformation, and audio generation.

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Content Extraction from Telegram**
   - Fetch daily messages from predefined **Telegram channels** using **Telethon API**.
   - Extract **text, images, and URLs**.
   - Store raw data in **Supabase** for further processing.

2. **Data Processing & Structuring**
   - Filter irrelevant messages (e.g., duplicate content, low-engagement messages).
   - Organize messages chronologically for coherence.
   - Summarize long messages to optimize spoken output.
   - Assign metadata (e.g., categories, timestamps, source details).

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion**
   - Use **Podcastfy library** on **AWS Lambda** to generate speech from text.
   - Explore integration with **OpenAI's advanced voice model** for **Hebrew language support**.
   - Generate audio files in **MP3 format**.

4. **Audio Processing & Storage**
   - Apply noise reduction and volume normalization.
   - Store processed files on **Podbean (storage layer)**.
   - Generate **RSS feed links** for podcast distribution.

5. **Podcast Distribution**
   - Email podcast episodes to **subscribed users** using **Mailgun**.
   - Publish episodes to **public podcast directories** (optional future feature).

## Key Considerations
- **Error Handling:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls.
- **Language Support:** Evaluate different TTS models for optimal Hebrew voice quality.
- **Scheduling:** Automate pipeline execution on a **daily basis** using a cron job.
- **Scalability:** Ensure AWS Lambda efficiently handles increased processing demands.

This structured flow ensures a streamlined and scalable podcast generation process, providing users with high-quality, daily audio content.
