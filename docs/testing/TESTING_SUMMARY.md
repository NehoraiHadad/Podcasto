## Feature Overview

### What Was Implemented

**Phase 1: Database Schema + Types** (Completed)
- Added `podcast_format` enum field to `podcast_configs` table
- Made `speaker2_role` nullable
- Created migration scripts
- Updated TypeScript types

**Phase 2: UI Components + Backend Infrastructure** (Completed)
- Created `FormatSelector` component
- Updated `StyleRolesFields` component with conditional rendering
- Implemented validation logic
- Updated server actions
- Added SQS message format tracking

**Phase 3: Lambda Functions** (Completed)
- Modified Script Generator for single-speaker monologue generation
- Updated Audio Generator for single-voice synthesis
- Implemented voice selection logic based on format
- Added comprehensive logging

### Key Capabilities

1. **Format Selection**: Users can choose between single-speaker and multi-speaker formats
2. **Validation**: System enforces that multi-speaker podcasts must have speaker2_role
3. **Script Generation**: Different prompts and structures for each format
4. **Audio Generation**: Voice selection adapts to podcast format
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing multi-speaker podcasts unaffected

## Testing Approach

### Testing Strategy

**Multi-Layered Testing**:
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component and function testing
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-component and service integration
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Full user journey validation
4. **Manual Testing**: Audio quality and user experience validation
5. **Regression Testing**: Ensure multi-speaker functionality unchanged

**Testing Philosophy**:
- Test both formats comprehensively
- Validate data integrity at every layer
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Focus on audio quality validation
- Verify format tracking throughout pipeline
