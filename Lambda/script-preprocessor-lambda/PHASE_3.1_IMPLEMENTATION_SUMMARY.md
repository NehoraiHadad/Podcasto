## Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

This document summarizes the implementation of single-speaker script generation in the Script Preprocessor Lambda.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/Lambda/script-preprocessor-lambda/src/handlers/script_preprocessor_handler.py`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Extract `podcast_format` from SQS message (from `dynamic_config` or message root)
- ‚úÖ Pass `podcast_format` to `_apply_dynamic_role()` method
- ‚úÖ Pass `podcast_format` to `script_generator.generate_script()`
- ‚úÖ Include `podcast_format` in `dynamic_config` for Audio Generation Lambda
- ‚úÖ Include `podcast_format` in episode metadata
- ‚úÖ Updated `_apply_dynamic_role()` to handle single-speaker voice selection (speaker2 = None)

**Code Additions:**

```python
# Extract podcast_format from message
dynamic_config_in_message = msg.get("dynamic_config", {})
podcast_format = dynamic_config_in_message.get('podcast_format') or msg.get('podcast_format', 'multi-speaker')

# Pass to dynamic role application
dynamic_config = self._apply_dynamic_role(podcast_config, analysis, episode_id, podcast_format)

# Add to dynamic config for audio generation
dynamic_config['podcast_format'] = podcast_format

# Pass to script generator
script, content_metrics = self.script_generator.generate_script(
    clean_content, dynamic_config, episode_id, podcast_format
)

# Include in episode metadata
episode_metadata = {
    "speaker1_voice": dynamic_config['speaker1_voice'],
    "speaker2_voice": dynamic_config.get('speaker2_voice'),  # None for single-speaker
    "speaker1_role": dynamic_config['speaker1_role'],
    "speaker2_role": dynamic_config.get('speaker2_role'),  # None for single-speaker
    "podcast_format": podcast_format
}
```

**Single-Speaker Voice Selection:**
```python
def _apply_dynamic_role(self, cfg, analysis, episode_id, podcast_format='multi-speaker'):
    if podcast_format == 'single-speaker':
        # Skip speaker2 configuration
        new_cfg["speaker2_role"] = None
        new_cfg["speaker2_gender"] = None

        # Select only speaker1 voice (use dummy values for speaker2)
        speaker1_voice, _ = self.voice_manager.get_distinct_voices_for_speakers(
            language=language,
            speaker1_gender=speaker1_gender,
            speaker2_gender='male',  # dummy
            speaker1_role=speaker1_role,
            speaker2_role='Unused',  # dummy
            episode_id=episode_id,
            randomize_speaker2=False
        )

        new_cfg["speaker1_voice"] = speaker1_voice
        new_cfg["speaker2_voice"] = None
```

---

### 2. `/Lambda/script-preprocessor-lambda/src/services/gemini_script_generator.py`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `generate_script()` to accept `podcast_format` parameter
- ‚úÖ Added routing logic to call appropriate generation method
- ‚úÖ Renamed `_generate_ai_script()` ‚Üí `_generate_multi_speaker_script()`
- ‚úÖ Created new `_generate_single_speaker_script()` method
- ‚úÖ Created new `_build_single_speaker_prompt()` method with full adaptive instructions

**Routing Logic:**

```python
def generate_script(self, clean_content, podcast_config=None, episode_id=None, podcast_format='multi-speaker'):
    logger.info(f"[GEMINI_SCRIPT] Starting {podcast_format} script generation")

    # ... content metrics analysis ...

    # Route to appropriate generation method
    if podcast_format == 'single-speaker':
        script = self._generate_single_speaker_script(
            clean_content_prioritized, config, episode_id, content_metrics
        )
    else:
        script = self._generate_multi_speaker_script(
            clean_content_prioritized, config, episode_id, content_metrics
        )

    return script, content_metrics
```

**Single-Speaker Script Generation:**

```python
def _generate_single_speaker_script(self, clean_content, podcast_config, episode_id=None, content_metrics=None):
    """Generate natural single-speaker monologue script using Gemini AI"""

    # Get configuration (only speaker1)
    speaker1_role = podcast_config.get("speaker1_role", "Host")
    speaker1_gender = podcast_config.get("speaker1_gender", "male")
    # ... other config ...

    # Build single-speaker prompt
    prompt = self._build_single_speaker_prompt(
        clean_content=clean_content,
        language=language,
        speaker1_role=speaker1_role,
        speaker1_gender=speaker1_gender,
        # ... other params ...
    )

    # Generate with Gemini (same temperature 0.7 as multi-speaker)
    response = self.client.models.generate_content(
        model=self.model,
        contents=prompt,
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            temperature=0.7,
            max_output_tokens=32768,
        )
    )

    # Validate and return
    cleaned_script = response.text.strip()
    self._validate_script_content(cleaned_script)
    return cleaned_script
```

---

## Single-Speaker Prompt Structure

The `_build_single_speaker_prompt()` method includes ALL critical components:

### 1. Voice Selection (Single Voice Only)
```python
speaker1_voice, _ = voice_manager.get_distinct_voices_for_speakers(
    language=language,
    speaker1_gender=speaker1_gender,
    speaker2_gender='male',  # dummy
    speaker1_role=speaker1_role,
    speaker2_role='Unused',  # dummy
    episode_id=episode_id,
    randomize_speaker2=False
)
```

### 2. Adaptive Instructions (IDENTICAL to Multi-Speaker)

**Compression Strategy** (High Content Volume):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è CONTENT VOLUME ALERT: HIGH (X messages, Y characters)

**üéØ COMPRESSION STRATEGY REQUIRED:**
1. Coverage Mode: SELECTIVE (5-7 key topics maximum)
2. Detail Level: SUMMARY
3. Target Script Length: ~Z characters
4. Be MORE CONCISE than the source material
```

**Expansion Strategy** (Low Content Volume):
```
üìù CONTENT VOLUME: LOW (X messages, Y characters)

**üéØ EXPANSION STRATEGY - STAY GROUNDED:**
1. Coverage Mode: COMPREHENSIVE (cover ALL topics)
2. Detail Level: DETAILED with context
3. Target Script Length: ~Z characters
4. CRITICAL - Avoid "Filler" Content
```

**Balanced Strategy** (Normal Content Volume):
```
‚öñÔ∏è CONTENT VOLUME: BALANCED (X messages, Y characters)

**üéØ BALANCED STRATEGY:**
1. Coverage Mode: NATURAL
2. Detail Level: MODERATE
3. Target Script Length: ~Z characters (aim for 1:1 ratio)
```

### 3. Monologue Structure Guidelines

```
**MONOLOGUE STRUCTURE:**
1. Hook (30-60 sec): Grab attention with compelling opening
2. Introduction: Preview today's content clearly
3. Main Content: Deep dive organized into clear sections
4. Transitions: "Let me explain...", "Here's what's interesting..."
5. Closing: Summary with key takeaways

**NARRATIVE TECHNIQUES FOR SOLO DELIVERY:**
- Direct Address: "You know what I find fascinating?"
- Rhetorical Questions: "So what does this mean for us?"
- Personal Insights: "In my experience...", "What struck me..."
- Storytelling: Present information as a journey
- Audience Engagement: "Think about this...", "Imagine if..."
```

### 4. TTS Markup (Same as Multi-Speaker)

```
**TTS MARKUP FOR EXPRESSIVE MONOLOGUE DELIVERY:**
1. Timing and Rhythm: [pause], [extremely fast]
2. Emotional Delivery: [excited], [curious], [thoughtful], [amused]
3. Emphasis: [emphasis]text[/emphasis]
4. Natural Speech: Minimal fillers (1-2 per topic maximum)
5. Content-Specific: [emphasis] for breaking news, etc.
```

### 5. Critical Requirements

```
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: NO SPEAKER NAMES IN CONTENT**
- The speaker role (e.g., "Host") is ONLY for script format
- DO NOT invent names: no "◊ô◊ï◊ë◊ú", "Michael", "Sarah", etc.
- DO NOT use placeholders: "[◊©◊ù]", "[name]", "___"
- Keep delivery natural and direct without personal names
```

### 6. Output Format

```
**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{speaker1_role}: [excited] Opening statement that grabs attention...
{speaker1_role}: [pause] Now, let me explain why this matters...
{speaker1_role}: [emphasis]Key point[/emphasis] that you need to understand...
{speaker1_role}: [thoughtful] When you think about it, what's really happening here is...
```

### 7. Examples Provided

- Example 1: Engaging Opening (English)
- Example 2: Thoughtful Explanation (English)
- Example 3: Natural Hebrew Monologue
- Example 4: Building Narrative
- Example 5: Rhetorical Engagement

## Data Flow for Phase 3.2 (Audio Generation)

The Script Preprocessor now passes the following structure to Audio Generation Lambda via SQS:

```json
{
  "episode_id": "episode-uuid",
  "podcast_id": "podcast-uuid",
  "podcast_config_id": "config-uuid",
  "script_url": "s3://bucket/podcasts/.../script.txt",
  "dynamic_config": {
    "podcast_format": "single-speaker",
    "speaker1_role": "Host",
    "speaker2_role": null,
    "speaker1_voice": "Alnilam",
    "speaker2_voice": null,
    "speaker1_gender": "male",
    "speaker2_gender": null,
    "language": "he",
    "content_analysis": { ... },
    "topic_analysis": { ... }
  }
}
```

**Key Points for Audio Generation Lambda:**
- ‚úÖ `podcast_format` is available in `dynamic_config`
- ‚úÖ `speaker2_role` is `null` for single-speaker
- ‚úÖ `speaker2_voice` is `null` for single-speaker
- ‚úÖ Script format uses `speaker1_role` prefix only
- ‚úÖ TTS markup structure is identical to multi-speaker

## Example Generated Scripts

### Single-Speaker Script (English):

```
Host: [excited] Okay, so you won't believe what happened today in the tech world!
Host: [pause] I'm talking about something that's going to change how we think about artificial intelligence.
Host: [curious] Now, you might be wondering, what makes this so special?
Host: [thoughtful] Let me break this down for you, because it's actually more interesting than it sounds.
Host: Think of it this way... imagine you're trying to solve a really complex puzzle.
Host: [emphasis]The key insight[/emphasis] here is that the traditional approach just doesn't work anymore.
Host: [excited] Well, it turns out that [emphasis]everything[/emphasis] connects back to that!
Host: So here's where things get really interesting...
```

### Single-Speaker Script (Hebrew):

```
◊û◊†◊ó◊î: [excited] ◊ê◊ï◊ß◊ô◊ô, ◊ê◊ñ ◊ú◊ê ◊™◊ê◊û◊ô◊†◊ï ◊û◊î ◊ß◊®◊î ◊î◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊ë◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊î◊ò◊õ◊†◊ï◊ú◊ï◊í◊ô◊î!
◊û◊†◊ó◊î: [pause] ◊ê◊†◊ô ◊û◊ì◊ë◊® ◊¢◊ú ◊û◊©◊î◊ï ◊©◊¢◊ï◊û◊ì ◊ú◊©◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊ì◊®◊ö ◊©◊ë◊î ◊ê◊†◊ó◊†◊ï ◊ó◊ï◊©◊ë◊ô◊ù ◊¢◊ú ◊ë◊ô◊†◊î ◊û◊ú◊ê◊õ◊ï◊™◊ô◊™.
◊û◊†◊ó◊î: [curious] ◊¢◊õ◊©◊ô◊ï, ◊ê◊™◊ù ◊ë◊ò◊ó ◊©◊ï◊ê◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊™ ◊¢◊¶◊û◊õ◊ù, ◊û◊î ◊õ◊ú ◊õ◊ö ◊û◊ô◊ï◊ó◊ì ◊ë◊ñ◊î?
◊û◊†◊ó◊î: [thoughtful] ◊™◊†◊ï ◊ú◊ô ◊ú◊î◊°◊ë◊ô◊® ◊ú◊õ◊ù, ◊õ◊ô ◊ñ◊î ◊ë◊¢◊¶◊ù ◊ô◊ï◊™◊® ◊û◊¢◊†◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊û◊û◊î ◊©◊ñ◊î ◊†◊©◊û◊¢.
◊û◊†◊ó◊î: ◊™◊ó◊©◊ë◊ï ◊¢◊ú ◊ñ◊î ◊õ◊õ◊î... ◊ì◊û◊ô◊ô◊†◊ï ◊©◊ê◊™◊ù ◊û◊†◊°◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊§◊™◊ï◊® ◊ó◊ô◊ì◊î ◊û◊û◊© ◊û◊ï◊®◊õ◊ë◊™.
◊û◊†◊ó◊î: [emphasis]◊î◊™◊ï◊ë◊†◊î ◊î◊û◊®◊õ◊ñ◊ô◊™[/emphasis] ◊õ◊ê◊ü ◊î◊ô◊ê ◊©◊î◊í◊ô◊©◊î ◊î◊û◊°◊ï◊®◊™◊ô◊™ ◊§◊©◊ï◊ò ◊ú◊ê ◊¢◊ï◊ë◊ì◊™ ◊ô◊ï◊™◊®.
```

### Multi-Speaker Script (Unchanged - Backward Compatible):

```
Host: [excited] Wait, so you're telling me this actually happened? That's incredible!
Expert: [amused] I know, right? When I first heard about it, I thought, no way this is real.
Host: [curious] Okay, so walk me through this... how did it all start?
Expert: [thoughtful] Well, it's a bit more complex than that. Think of it this way...
Host: Okay, I think I'm following.
Expert: Right! So basically, what we're seeing is... actually, let me give you an example.
```

2. Test single-speaker voice selection (speaker2 = None)
3. Test routing logic in `generate_script()`
4. Test single-speaker prompt generation
5. Test multi-speaker backward compatibility

### Integration Testing:
1. Generate test script with `podcast_format = 'single-speaker'` (Hebrew)
2. Generate test script with `podcast_format = 'single-speaker'` (English)
3. Generate test script with `podcast_format = 'multi-speaker'` (verify no regression)
4. Verify SQS message structure to Audio Lambda
5. Check script structure and TTS markup
6. Verify no personal names in generated scripts

### Content Quality Testing:
1. Verify adaptive instructions work correctly:
   - High content ‚Üí compression strategy
   - Low content ‚Üí expansion strategy
   - Balanced content ‚Üí balanced strategy
2. Verify monologue flow (no back-and-forth)
3. Verify TTS markup quality
4. Verify Hebrew and English generation quality

---

## Dependencies for Phase 3.2 (Audio Generation Lambda)

Phase 3.2 can now proceed with confidence that the following are provided:

1. ‚úÖ `podcast_format` in `dynamic_config` (either "single-speaker" or "multi-speaker")
2. ‚úÖ `speaker2_role` is `None` for single-speaker podcasts
3. ‚úÖ `speaker2_voice` is `None` for single-speaker podcasts
4. ‚úÖ Script format uses `speaker1_role` prefix consistently
5. ‚úÖ TTS markup structure identical to multi-speaker
6. ‚úÖ No personal names in script content
7. ‚úÖ Adaptive content logic included (compression/expansion)

**Next Steps for Phase 3.2 Agent:**
- Update Audio Generation Lambda to parse `podcast_format` from `dynamic_config`
- Route to single-speaker TTS processing when `podcast_format == 'single-speaker'`
- Skip speaker2 voice processing when `speaker2_role` is `None`
- Use same TTS markup parsing for both formats

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Multi-Speaker Podcasts:
- ‚úÖ Existing multi-speaker podcasts work unchanged
- ‚úÖ If `podcast_format` is not provided, defaults to "multi-speaker"
- ‚úÖ `_generate_multi_speaker_script()` (formerly `_generate_ai_script()`) unchanged
- ‚úÖ Multi-speaker prompt logic unchanged
- ‚úÖ All existing tests should pass

### Database Migration:
- ‚úÖ `podcast_format` column already exists (added in Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Default value is "multi-speaker" for existing podcasts
- ‚úÖ No additional database changes needed

---

## Logging & Debugging

### Log Messages Added:

**Handler:**
```
[PREPROC] Selected single voice for episode {episode_id}: {speaker1_role}={speaker1_voice}
[PREPROC] Selected voices for episode {episode_id}: {speaker1_role}={speaker1_voice}, {speaker2_role}={speaker2_voice}
```

**Script Generator:**
```
[GEMINI_SCRIPT] Starting {podcast_format} script generation
[GEMINI_SCRIPT] Format: {podcast_format}
[GEMINI_SCRIPT] Speaker gender: {speaker1_gender}  (single-speaker)
[GEMINI_SCRIPT] Speaker genders: Speaker1={speaker1_gender}, Speaker2={speaker2_gender}  (multi-speaker)
```

---

## Error Handling

### Potential Issues & Solutions:

1. **Missing `podcast_format` in message:**
   - Solution: Defaults to "multi-speaker" (backward compatible)

2. **Invalid `podcast_format` value:**
   - Solution: Defaults to "multi-speaker" if not recognized

3. **Single-speaker with speaker2 data:**
   - Solution: Handler explicitly sets speaker2_role and speaker2_voice to None

4. **Script generation failure:**
   - Solution: Same exception handling as multi-speaker (logs error, raises exception)

---

## Performance Considerations

### No Performance Impact:
- ‚úÖ Single routing decision added (negligible cost)
- ‚úÖ Voice selection call structure identical (one less voice selected for single-speaker)
- ‚úÖ Gemini API call identical (same model, temperature, max_tokens)
- ‚úÖ Prompt size comparable (single-speaker prompt ~same length as multi-speaker)

### Potential Improvements:
- Script generation time should be similar to multi-speaker
- May be slightly faster due to simpler structure (no speaker coordination)
