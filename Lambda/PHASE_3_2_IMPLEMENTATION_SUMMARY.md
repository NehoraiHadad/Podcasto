# Phase 3.2: Audio Generation Lambda - Single-Speaker TTS Support

## Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Mission:** Update Audio Generation Lambda to support single-speaker TTS configuration using Google Gemini VoiceConfig

---

## Overview

This phase implemented full single-speaker podcast support in the Audio Generation Lambda while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with multi-speaker format. The implementation uses Google Gemini's `VoiceConfig` for single-speaker (instead of `MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig`) to ensure proper voice consistency.

---

## Key Implementation Details

### 1. Handler Updates (`audio_generation_handler.py`)

**Changes:**
- Extract `podcast_format` from `dynamic_config` (defaults to 'multi-speaker' for backward compatibility)
- Pass `podcast_format` to audio generation method
- Conditionally pass speaker2 parameters only for multi-speaker format

**Code Location:** Lines 194-196, 225, 404-443

```python
# Extract podcast_format from dynamic_config
podcast_format = dynamic_config.get('podcast_format', 'multi-speaker')
logger.info(f"[AUDIO_GEN] [{request_id}] podcast_format: {podcast_format}")

# Pass to generator with conditional speaker2 params
audio_data, duration = generator.generate_podcast_audio(
    script_content=script,
    language=language,
    speaker1_role=speaker1_role,
    speaker2_role=speaker2_role if podcast_format == 'multi-speaker' else None,
    speaker1_gender=speaker1_gender,
    speaker2_gender=speaker2_gender if podcast_format == 'multi-speaker' else None,
    episode_id=episode_id,
    is_pre_processed=is_pre_processed,
    content_type=content_type,
    speaker1_voice=speaker1_voice,
    speaker2_voice=speaker2_voice if podcast_format == 'multi-speaker' else None,
    podcast_format=podcast_format
)
```

---

### 2. Generator Updates (`google_podcast_generator.py`)

**Changes:**
- Added `podcast_format` parameter to `generate_podcast_audio()`
- Routing logic to direct to single-speaker or multi-speaker methods
- Created `_generate_single_speaker_chunked()` method for long single-speaker scripts
- Validation to ensure required voices are present

**Code Location:** Lines 23-128, 170-250

**Single-Speaker Path:**
```python
if podcast_format == 'single-speaker':
    logger.info(f"[GOOGLE_TTS] Using single-speaker generation")

    # Validate speaker1_voice is provided
    if not speaker1_voice:
        raise ValueError("speaker1_voice not provided for single-speaker format")

    # Route to chunked or single processing
    if len(script_content) > self.chunk_manager.max_chars_per_chunk:
        return self._generate_single_speaker_chunked(...)
    else:
        return self.tts_client.generate_single_speaker_audio(...)
```

**Multi-Speaker Path (existing logic):**
```python
else:
    logger.info(f"[GOOGLE_TTS] Using multi-speaker generation")

    # Validate both voices are provided
    if not speaker1_voice or not speaker2_voice:
        raise ValueError("Voices not provided for multi-speaker format")

    # Existing chunked/single logic
    ...
```

---

### 3. TTS Client Updates (`tts_client.py`)

**New Methods:**

#### `generate_single_speaker_audio()`
- **Purpose:** Generate audio using single `VoiceConfig` (NOT `MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig`)
- **Location:** Lines 328-483
- **Key Differences from Multi-Speaker:**
  - Uses `types.VoiceConfig` with single `PrebuiltVoiceConfig`
  - No speaker role prefixes needed in prompt
  - Same TTS markup support ([pause], [emphasis], etc.)
  - Same timeout and rate limiting protection

```python
# Single-speaker voice configuration
speech_config = types.SpeechConfig(
    voice_config=types.VoiceConfig(
        prebuilt_voice_config=types.PrebuiltVoiceConfig(voice_name=speaker_voice)
    )
)
```

#### `generate_single_speaker_chunk_with_retry()`
- **Purpose:** Chunk processing with retry logic for single-speaker format
- **Location:** Lines 485-572
- **Features:**
  - 3 retry attempts per chunk (configurable)
  - Validation with silence detection
  - Smart error handling (defer on timeout/rate limit, retry on 500 errors)
  - Voice consistency verification

## Voice Configuration Flow

### Single-Speaker
1. **Script Preprocessor** (Phase 3.1) selects `speaker1_voice`, sets `speaker2_voice = None`
2. **Handler** extracts `podcast_format = 'single-speaker'`
3. **Generator** routes to single-speaker methods
4. **TTS Client** uses `VoiceConfig` with single voice
5. **Gemini TTS** generates audio with consistent voice throughout

### Multi-Speaker (Unchanged)
1. **Script Preprocessor** selects both voices
2. **Handler** extracts `podcast_format = 'multi-speaker'` (default)
3. **Generator** routes to multi-speaker methods (existing logic)
4. **TTS Client** uses `MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig` with two voices
5. **Gemini TTS** generates audio with distinct speakers

## Critical Features Maintained

### Voice Consistency ✅
- Pre-selected voices from Script Preprocessor ensure consistency
- Deterministic voice recovery if SQS message loses voice info
- Same voice used across all chunks in parallel processing

### Chunking & Parallel Processing ✅
- Single-speaker supports same chunking logic as multi-speaker
- Parallel processing for improved performance
- Voice consistency verified across chunks

### Error Handling ✅
- DeferrableError for timeout/rate limits (episode returns to script_ready)
- Smart retry for 500 errors (transient Google failures)
- Episode marked as 'failed' only for non-recoverable errors

### TTS Markup Support ✅
- Same markup supported: [pause], [excited], [emphasis]
- Hebrew niqqud processing unchanged
- Content-type specific speech optimization

### Backward Compatibility ✅
- `podcast_format` defaults to 'multi-speaker'
- Existing multi-speaker podcasts continue to work
- No changes to database schema or API responses

---

## Response Format

Both formats return identical response structure:

```python
{
    'status': 'success',
    'episode_id': episode_id,
    'audio_url': audio_url,
    'duration': duration,
    'content_type': content_info.get('content_type', 'general'),
    'speaker2_role': dynamic_config.get('speaker2_role', 'Speaker 2'),  # None for single-speaker
    'role_description': content_info.get('role_description', ''),
    'confidence': content_info.get('confidence', 0.0),
    'has_niqqud': niqqud_script is not None
}
```
