# Podcast Group Creation Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete workflow for creating multilingual podcast groups from scratch in one flow.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Route: `/admin/podcasts/groups/create`
**File:** `src/app/admin/podcasts/groups/create/page.tsx`

- Admin-only page for creating podcast groups
- Protected by `checkIsAdmin()` middleware
- Clear instructions for creating multilingual podcast groups

### 2. Podcast Group Creation Form Components
**Directory:** `src/components/admin/podcast-group-creation-form/`

#### Main Components:
- **`index.tsx`**: Main form component that orchestrates the entire creation flow
- **`base-fields.tsx`**: Base group information fields (title, description, cover image)
- **`language-variant-creation-card.tsx`**: Full podcast creation form for each language variant
- **`schema.ts`**: Zod validation schemas for the creation form

#### Features:
- Dynamic language variant management (add/remove)
- Tab-based interface for each language variant with 5 tabs:
  1. **Basic Info**: Language code, primary flag, title, description, cover image
  2. **Content Source**: Telegram or URLs configuration
  3. **Settings**: Creator, podcast name, output language, slogan, creativity level
  4. **Advanced**: Long podcast toggle, discussion rounds, character limits, episode frequency
  5. **Style**: Conversation style, speaker roles, mixing techniques, additional instructions
- Real-time validation with error display
- Submission with progress indication
- Automatic redirect to groups view on success

### 3. Comprehensive Server Action
**File:** `src/lib/actions/podcast-group-actions.ts`

#### Action: `createPodcastGroupWithNewPodcastsAction()`
Creates podcasts + group + language variants in one transaction with rollback support.

**Flow:**
1. Validates admin access
2. Validates at least one primary language
3. Creates all individual podcasts with metadata
4. Creates podcast configs for each podcast
5. Creates the podcast group
6. Creates language variant records
7. Links all podcasts to the group
8. Returns complete group with all languages

**Error Handling:**
- Automatic rollback if any step fails
- Deletes created podcasts if group creation fails
- Returns descriptive error messages
- Console logging for debugging

### 4. Updated Navigation
**File:** `src/components/admin/server-podcasts-list.tsx`

#### All Podcasts View:
- "Migrate to Groups" button
- "Create Group" button (new)
- "Create Single Podcast" button (renamed from "Create New Podcast")

#### Podcast Groups View:
- "Migrate Existing" button (renamed from "Migrate to Groups")
- "Create Podcast Group" button (new, primary action)

#### Empty States:
- Updated messages to clarify single vs. group creation
- Clear call-to-action buttons for both creation types

## User Flow

### Creating a New Podcast Group:

1. **Navigate**: Admin goes to `/admin/podcasts?view=groups`
2. **Click**: "Create Podcast Group" button
3. **Fill Base Info**:
   - Base title (required)
   - Base description (optional)
   - Base cover image URL (optional)

4. **Add Language Variants** (click "Add Language Variant"):
   - For each variant, fill:
     - Language code and primary flag
     - Full podcast details across 5 tabs
     - Content source configuration
     - Podcast configuration and style

5. **Submit**: Click "Create Podcast Group (X variants)"
   - System creates all podcasts
   - System creates the group
   - System links everything together
   - Success message with count of variants created
   - Redirect to groups view

### Navigation Options:

From `/admin/podcasts`:
- **Create Single Podcast** → `/admin/podcasts/create` (traditional flow)
- **Create Group** → `/admin/podcasts/groups/create` (new flow)
- **Migrate to Groups** → `/admin/podcasts/migrate` (existing flow)

From `/admin/podcasts?view=groups`:
- **Create Podcast Group** → `/admin/podcasts/groups/create` (new flow)
- **Migrate Existing** → `/admin/podcasts/migrate` (existing flow)

## Technical Details

### Schema Structure:
```typescript
PodcastGroupCreationFormValues {
  base_title: string;
  base_description?: string;
  base_cover_image?: string;
  languages: LanguageVariantCreationValues[];
}

LanguageVariantCreationValues {
  // Language info
  language_code: string;
  is_primary: boolean;

  // Podcast metadata
  title: string;
  description: string;
  cover_image?: string;
  image_style?: string;

  // Content source (discriminated union)
  contentSource: 'telegram' | 'urls';
  // ... all podcast config fields
}
```

### Validation Rules:
- At least one language variant required
- At least one language must be marked as primary
- Title minimum 3 characters
- Description minimum 10 characters
- Telegram channel required when content source is telegram
- At least one URL required when content source is urls
- All numeric fields have min/max constraints

### Data Transformation:
The form data is transformed before submission:
- URLs are filtered to remove empty/undefined values
- Creativity level is converted from 0-1 to 0-100 (percentage)
- Optional fields are converted to null for database storage
- Language variants are mapped to the action's expected format

### Transaction Safety:
- If any podcast creation fails, all previously created podcasts are deleted
- If group creation fails, all created podcasts are deleted
- If language variant creation fails, rollback occurs
- Console logging at each step for debugging
