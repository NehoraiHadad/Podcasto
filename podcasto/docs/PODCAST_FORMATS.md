## Technical Differences

### Voice Generation

**Single-Speaker:**
```python
# TTS Configuration
voice_config = VoiceConfig(
    prebuilt_voice_config=PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
        voice_name="Alnilam"  # Single voice
    )
)
```

**Multi-Speaker:**
```python
# TTS Configuration
multi_speaker_config = MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig([
    Speaker(
        speaker_id="1",
        voice_config=VoiceConfig(
            prebuilt_voice_config=PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
                voice_name="Alnilam"
            )
        )
    ),
    Speaker(
        speaker_id="2",
        voice_config=VoiceConfig(
            prebuilt_voice_config=PrebuiltVoiceConfig(
                voice_name="Aoede"
            )
        )
    )
])
```

### Script Format

**Single-Speaker:**
```
Today's tech news highlights three major developments...
The first story covers the latest AI breakthrough...
In other news, a new smartphone was announced...
```

**Multi-Speaker:**
```
Host: Welcome to today's tech news roundup!
Expert: Thanks for having me. We've got some exciting stories today.
Host: Let's start with the AI breakthrough. What's your take?
Expert: This is really significant because...
```

### Processing Pipeline

Both formats follow the same pipeline:
1. Telegram Lambda fetches messages
2. Script Preprocessor generates script (format-aware)
3. Audio Generation creates audio (format-specific TTS config)
4. Episode published with audio

**Key Difference:** The `podcast_format` field determines:
- Script generation style (narration vs dialogue)
- TTS configuration (single vs multi-speaker)
- Voice selection logic

---

## Migration Considerations

### Changing Formats

**Important:** You cannot change the podcast format after episodes have been created.

**If you need to change format:**
1. Create a new podcast configuration with the desired format
2. Set up all settings (matching the old podcast if desired)
3. Generate episodes with the new podcast
4. Optionally archive the old podcast

**Why no format switching?**
- Voice consistency across episodes
- Script structure compatibility
- Listener expectations
- Technical constraints

### Testing Formats

**Recommendation:** Create test podcasts to try both formats:
1. Create test podcast with single-speaker
2. Generate 1-2 episodes
3. Create test podcast with multi-speaker
4. Generate 1-2 episodes
5. Compare and decide which works better
