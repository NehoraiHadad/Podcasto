- ✅ Automatic credit deduction (10 credits per episode)
- ✅ Skip generation if insufficient credits
- ✅ Proper error logging for credit issues

### 3. Episode Generation
- ✅ Integration with existing `generatePodcastEpisode` function
- ✅ Uses established Lambda workflow
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery
- ✅ Status updates in database

### 4. Security
- ✅ CRON endpoint protected by secret

- ✅ Skip/fail reason tracking

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems Used
1. **Credit Service** (`src/lib/services/credits/credit-service.ts`)
   - `checkCreditsForEpisode(userId)`
   - `deductCreditsForEpisode(userId, episodeId, podcastId)`

2. **Episode Generation** (`src/lib/actions/podcast/generate.ts`)
   - `generatePodcastEpisode(podcastId, dateRange?)`

3. **Database APIs** (`src/lib/db/api/`)
   - `podcastsApi.getPodcastById(id)`
   - `podcastsApi.updatePodcast(id, data)`

4. **Auth System** (`src/lib/auth.ts`)
   - `getUser()` for authentication
   - `checkIsAdmin()` for authorization

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local` or production environment:

```bash
# CRON Security (REQUIRED)
CRON_SECRET=your-random-secure-secret-here

# Existing variables (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AUDIO_GENERATION_QUEUE_URL=...
```

### Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` has been updated to include:

```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/scheduled-episodes",
    "schedule": "0 * * * *"
  }]
}
```

This will automatically run the scheduled episodes job every hour on Vercel.

## API Reference

### Server Actions

#### Update Scheduling Settings
```typescript
import { updateSchedulingSettingsAction } from '@/lib/actions/podcast/scheduling-actions';

const result = await updateSchedulingSettingsAction(podcastId, {
  auto_generation_enabled: true,
  episode_frequency: 7  // days
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Auto-generation enabled!');
}
```

#### Get Scheduling Status
```typescript
import { getSchedulingStatusAction } from '@/lib/actions/podcast/scheduling-actions';

const result = await getSchedulingStatusAction(podcastId);

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Next generation:', result.data.next_scheduled_generation);
  console.log('Last generated:', result.data.last_auto_generated_at);
  console.log('Frequency:', result.data.episode_frequency, 'days');
}
```

#### Trigger Manual Generation (Admin Only)
```typescript
import { triggerScheduledGenerationAction } from '@/lib/actions/podcast/scheduling-actions';

const result = await triggerScheduledGenerationAction();

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Generated: ${result.data.generated}`);
  console.log(`Skipped: ${result.data.skipped}`);
  console.log(`Failed: ${result.data.failed}`);
}
```

### CRON Endpoint

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}" \
  https://your-domain.com/api/cron/scheduled-episodes
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Generated episodes for 5/10 podcasts",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T17:00:00Z",
  "duration_ms": 12345,
  "results": {
    "total": 10,
    "generated": 5,
    "skipped": 3,
    "failed": 2,
    "details": [...]
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User enables auto-generation:**
   ```typescript
   await updateSchedulingSettingsAction(podcastId, {
     auto_generation_enabled: true,
     episode_frequency: 7
   });
   ```

2. **System calculates next generation time:**
   - If never generated: `next_scheduled_generation = now + 7 days`
   - If previously generated: `next_scheduled_generation = last_generated + 7 days`

3. **CRON runs every hour:**
   - Finds podcasts where `next_scheduled_generation <= now`
   - For each podcast:
     - Check user has 10 credits
     - Generate episode if credits available
     - Deduct 10 credits
     - Update `last_auto_generated_at = now`
     - Calculate new `next_scheduled_generation = now + frequency`

4. **User receives new episode automatically**

### Example Timeline

```
Day 1, 10:00 AM - User enables auto-gen with 7-day frequency
                  next_scheduled = Day 8, 10:00 AM

Day 8, 11:00 AM - CRON runs
                  Episode generated (user had 30 credits)
                  Credits deducted (20 remaining)
                  last_auto_generated_at = Day 8, 11:00 AM
                  next_scheduled = Day 15, 11:00 AM

Day 15, 11:00 AM - CRON runs
                   Episode generated (user had 20 credits)
                   Credits deducted (10 remaining)
                   next_scheduled = Day 22, 11:00 AM

Day 22, 11:00 AM - CRON runs
                   Episode generated (user had 10 credits)
                   Credits deducted (0 remaining)
                   next_scheduled = Day 29, 11:00 AM

Day 29, 11:00 AM - CRON runs
                   Skipped (insufficient credits: 0 < 10)
                   next_scheduled = Day 36, 11:00 AM
```

## Testing Checklist

### Before Deploying

- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] All imports resolved correctly
- [x] Database schema fields exist
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] vercel.json updated with cron schedule

### After Deploying

1. **Test Enable/Disable:**
   ```typescript
   // Enable
   const result = await updateSchedulingSettingsAction(testPodcastId, {
     auto_generation_enabled: true,
     episode_frequency: 1  // Use 1 day for testing
   });

   // Verify next_scheduled_generation is set
   const status = await getSchedulingStatusAction(testPodcastId);
   console.log(status.data);
   ```

2. **Test Manual Trigger (Admin):**
   ```typescript
   const result = await triggerScheduledGenerationAction();
   console.log(result.data.details);
   ```

3. **Test CRON Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
     https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/cron/scheduled-episodes
   ```

4. **Test Credit Deduction:**
   - Enable auto-gen for podcast
   - Wait for scheduled time (or trigger manually)
   - Verify credits decreased by 10
   - Check credit_transactions table for record

5. **Test Insufficient Credits:**
   - Set user credits to 5 (less than 10)
   - Trigger generation
   - Verify episode is skipped
   - Check logs for "insufficient_credits"

6. **Monitor First Hour:**
   - Check Vercel logs after CRON runs
   - Verify no errors
   - Confirm expected number of generations

## Success Criteria

All success criteria from the mission have been met:

- ✅ Scheduling service correctly calculates next generation time
- ✅ CRON job identifies podcasts due for generation
- ✅ Credit checking works before each generation
- ✅ Podcasts without credits are skipped (not failed)
- ✅ Timestamps update correctly after generation
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Works with existing episode generation flow
- ✅ Server actions allow user control over scheduling
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery

## Performance Considerations

- **Sequential Processing:** Podcasts processed one at a time to avoid overwhelming Lambda
- **Query Optimization:** Index recommendations:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_podcasts_auto_gen_schedule
  ON podcasts (auto_generation_enabled, next_scheduled_generation)
  WHERE auto_generation_enabled = true;
  ```
- **Timeout:** Each podcast generation isolated - failures don't affect others
- **Logging:** Detailed but not excessive

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications:**
   - Notify users when credits run low
   - Send weekly summary of generated episodes
   - Alert on generation failures

2. **User Dashboard:**
   - Show upcoming scheduled generations
   - Display credit usage trends
   - Episode generation history

3. **Advanced Scheduling:**
   - Specific days of week (e.g., only Mondays)
   - Specific time of day
   - Multiple episodes per week

4. **Analytics:**
   - Track generation success rates
   - Monitor credit consumption patterns
   - Identify problematic podcasts

5. **Retry Logic:**
   - Automatic retry for failed generations
   - Exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queue for persistent failures

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue: Episode not generating**
- Check `auto_generation_enabled = true`
- Verify `next_scheduled_generation <= now`
- Check user credit balance
- Review CRON logs

**Issue: CRON returns 401**
- Verify `CRON_SECRET` environment variable is set
- Ensure Authorization header format: `Bearer ${secret}`

**Issue: Credits not deducted**
- Check episode generation succeeded
- Review credit service logs
- Verify database triggers working

**Issue: Timestamps not updating**
- Check for generation errors in logs
- Verify database write permissions
- Ensure no transaction rollbacks

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Generation Success Rate:** `generated / total`
2. **Skip Rate:** `skipped / total`
3. **Failure Rate:** `failed / total`
4. **Average Generation Time:** Track `duration_ms`
5. **Credit Check Failures:** Count of insufficient credit skips

### Alert Thresholds

- **Critical:** Failure rate > 50%
- **Warning:** Skip rate > 30% (many users low on credits)
- **Info:** No generations in 24 hours (when podcasts are due)

### Log Queries

Search Vercel logs for:
- `[SCHEDULED_EPISODES_CRON]` - Main CRON activity
- `[SchedulingService]` - Service-level operations
- `✓ SUCCESS` - Successful generations
- `⊘ SKIPPED` - Skipped generations
- `✗ FAILED` - Failed generations

## Security Notes

- ✅ CRON endpoint requires secret token
- ✅ All user actions require authentication
- ✅ Ownership verified before updates
- ✅ Admin bypass only for testing actions
- ✅ SQL injection prevented (Drizzle ORM)
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs
